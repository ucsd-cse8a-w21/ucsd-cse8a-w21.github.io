# Introduction to Programming I (UCSD CSE 8A)

<a href="https://jpolitz.github.io">Joe Gibbs Politz</a> (Instructor)

In this course, you will learn to write, trace, and test programs; explore the
interactions between programs and data; and use computation to inspect and
manipulate media like data and images.

We will explore these topics interactively in lecture, you will implement
programs to practice your programming skills, and you will reflect on this
learning through your own program designs.

This web page will serve as the main source of announcements and resources
for the course, as well as the syllabus. It will get updates to the schedules
and calendars below as we go through each week.

### Open Lab and Help Hours
**Group help hours** are a great place for any kind of question about the course, from help with your assignment to clarifications about material in lecture to questions beyond what we cover in the course. It is good for group discussions where you can hear and interact with other students. Attendance is not required. Group assignments and more information can be found on this Edstem [post](https://edstem.org/us/courses/3266/discussion/213145).
The schedule for group help hours are in this calendar:

**1-on-1 open lab hours** is where TAs and tutors are available to answer your questions about any course content, though often this is a good place to go for programming help. At the times below, the course staff will be available to answer your questions, and it’s a great place to get debugging help, since you’ll be able to 1-on-1 screen share with a TA/tutor. 


The open lab hours are held on [Autograder](https://autograder.ucsd.edu/). You may find this [article](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ck_M0b9nrIjoCVxX0Fa5GCNnbCSCdJ_jBGLnJSaiQRE/) 
and this [page](https://autograder.ucsd.edu/help/518/student) from autograder helpful when using it. 
Please use the calendar below to find times at which tutors are available for 1-on-1 help to answer 
any questions you may have.

## Overview

In general, in a week in this course, you will:

- Complete **readings and exercises** in an online textbook hosted on
[Stepik](https://stepik.org/course/90691/syllabus) (completing the exercises
counts for credit), due on Friday at 4pm (including in week 1).
- Complete a **programming assignment or assessment**, due on Tuesday
at 4pm (first one due in week 2).
- Attend and participate a group, synchronous **lab exercise** session on
Wednesday (flexible scheduling, synchronous attendance expected), fill out
[this
survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScrxmgbgx9BCM8n_qo-BI4rKQAXhbGR2yf-sLrJGNYnanczSA/viewform)
ASAP so we can schedule you!
- Participate in, or watch later, **lecture sessions** on Tuesday and
Thursday evening (5-6:20pm or 6:30-8pm)
- Participate in, or watch later, **discussion sessions** on Friday (5-6pm or
6-7pm)
- Interact with me or other course staff to get some amount of help, either
through the message board, help hours, or one-on-one meetings.

In total, we aim for all of this (including lectures) to take you between
10-12 hours per week. If you find yourself taking substantially more than
that, consider asking the course staff for programming and study strategies.

## Calendar

The schedule below outlines topics, due dates, and links to assignments.
About a week in advance, all due dates, readings, and notable events in the
course. So if you check the schedule at the beginning of the week, you'll
know when all reading quizzes, programming assignments, etc. will be due.

Zoom only saves the recordings for up to 30 days, so if the recording links 
expire, please to go Canvas - Media Gallery for the videos. For each video, 
you can click on the Attachment tab to download the chat messages file.

<iframe src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQTwtGMeOD89lOwKQpMbDj97UqxUCQr6e3k3rOwhjtQfiBCVyHlGFni9C56EXDaq6vMR5tNigeYd8ou/pubhtml?gid=0&amp;single=true&amp;widget=true&amp;headers=false" style="border: none; border-top: 1px solid grey; border-spacing: 2px" width="100%" height="800px"></iframe>


## Grading

Your grade will be calculated from:

- 10% labs
- 10% reading, review, and drill exercises
- 40% programming **assignments** (PAs)
- 40% programming **assessments**
  - 3 during the quarter, plus one during finals week

The breakdown works like this:

- Labs and reading are evenly split across the weeks
- Programming **assignments** are weighted as follows:
    - PA1: 2 points
    - PA2/4/5/7/8: Two best scores worth 10 points each, next two best worth
    8, next best worth 6

    Note that this sums to 44 points, which is more than the total (40) for
    assignments. There is no extra credit, but if you miss or submit an
    assignment late, or make substantial mistakes, this gives you a way to make
    up lost credit by doing well on future assignments. Note also that
    completely skipping an assignment will hurt your grade, so you are always
    incentivized to make them up for late credit.
- Programming **assessments** are weighted as follows:
    - PA3: 6 points
    - PA6/9: Better score worth 16 points, worse score worth 8 points
    - Final assessment: worth 18 points

    Note that this sums to 48 points, which is more than the total for
    assessments (40). There is no make-up work for assessments, and no extra
    credit, but this policy allows you to make up some credit on future
    assessments if you miss or do poorly on one.


## Labs and Check-ins

Each week on Wednesday there will be synchronous lab sessions where you work
with several other students and a tutor to practice your programming skills.
During the first few days of the quarter, you'll fill out this survey so we
can know your availability for different times on Wednesday and schedule
accordingly:

[https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScrxmgbgx9BCM8n_qo-BI4rKQAXhbGR2yf-sLrJGNYnanczSA/viewform](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScrxmgbgx9BCM8n_qo-BI4rKQAXhbGR2yf-sLrJGNYnanczSA/viewform)

During lab, you will also have a chance for one-on-one check-ins with your
lab tutor for 5-10 minutes. This is a good time to ask any questions you have
about the course, note if you're struggling with particular concepts, need
help navigating the logistics of the course, and so on. You and your lab
tutor might schedule some additional time for a longer one-on-one meeting as
a result.

Labs will be designed to be collaborative activities, so you'll have to work
with your labmates to complete them and submit a summary document at the end
for credit. Labs are the **only** part of the course where synchronous
attendance is required for full credit. There will be make-up work available
if you miss a lab, but it will only earn half credit (note that this means
you can still get an A in the course without attending any labs, though we
don't recommend it).

## Reading, Review, and Drill

There is a free online textbook with built-in quizzes and practice activities
([https://stepik.org/course/90691/syllabus](https://stepik.org/course/90691/syllabus)).
You'll complete these for credit each week (due Friday 4pm), to get
conceptual background and practice with the new programming features for the
week. Your grade is based on the percentage of activities from the week's
chapter that you complete. You _can_ collaborate with other students on these
activities, and if you do it is your responsibility to make sure you
understand them thoroughly enough to demonstrate your understanding on
assessments.

## Programming Assignments and Assessments

There are two types of programming work you will do outside of class and lab
– programming _assignments_ and programming _assessments_ (collectively
referred to as “PAs”).

Programming _assignments_ are primarily for your learning. Typically these
will involve writing some amount of code to solve a problem or build
something cool, along with some related writing and reflection on the code
and your process. On these assignments, we encourage collaboration with other
students, will give you lots of feedback in order to improve your
submissions, and the course staff will answer many kinds of questions and
give lots of help.

Programming _assessments_ are primarily for us to assess your learning. They
will also have you write code to solve problems, but you must complete them
on your own, and the staff won't help you solve the problems or write code
for them. You can think of them as open-notes, open-book exams where instead
of solving problems on paper you will write a program. In addition, on
assessments, you will **record a short video** of you demonstrating how you
program works according to a prompt we give you. They may be released for
less than a full week, because the assessments are _shorter_ than the
assignments, so we really just want to give you enough time to schedule a 3-4
hour block of time to complete it as if it's an exam, not treat it like a
full-week project.

It's worth explaining why we are using this mechanism. There are at least two
reasons:

1. Presenting your code, and demonstrating it via screenshare, is a really
important skill and shows us a lot of your learning. Getting practice with this
style of presentation is a good thing for you to learn in general and a rich
way for us to assess your skills.
2. The main thing that in-person, on-paper exams let us do is easily verify
that it is in fact **you**, the student, completing a major assessment. We can
similarly do so with a video – many students are concerned that cheating will
be frequent in all-remote courses, and this is our way of ensuring that we are
giving grades to the people who earned them.

We will delete all the videos we receive from you after assigning final grades
for the course, and they will be stored in a university-controlled Google Drive
directory during the quarter only accessible to the course staff.

Please send a private message on to the instructor if you have concerns about
this exam policy or cannot complete exams in this style for some reason.

The schedule has a PA each week, where PAs 3, 6, and 9 are programming
_assessments_. There will also be a final programming assessment around the
time of your final exam.

## Late and Missed Work

There will be opportunities to regain **some** (not necessarily all) lost
credit on programming _assignments_ if you submit something incomplete or
miss the deadline, by resubmitting later with fixes. The details of this
process will be described along with the grades for the first programming
assignment.

Programming _assessments_ are like exams, so late work will not be accepted.
However, the combined grading policy for the assessments will allow some
flexibility in the event that you cannot complete one of them. That policy
will be posted here along with the release of the first _assessment_.

If you miss a lab, there will be a posted make-up activity that you can
complete on your own for **half** credit on that week's lab.

If you miss a week of Stepik quizzes/activities, we will give **half** credit
for finishing it after the deadline any time up to the end of the quarter.

Investigating the Impact of Pedagogical Choices on University Student Learning and Engagement

_Who is conducting the study, why you have been asked to participate, how you were selected, and what is the approximate number of participants in the study?_

Gabriele Wienhausen, Director of the Teaching and Learning Commons, together with her education research colleagues is conducting a research study to find out more about how pedagogical choices affect student learning and experience in the classroom. You have been asked to participate in this study because you are a student in a class that is being studied or used as a control. There will be approximately 500,000 participants in this study.

_Why is this study being done?_

The purpose of this study is to create knowledge that has the potential to improve the learning and educational experience of students at UC San Diego and beyond.

_What will happen to you in this study and which procedures are standard of care and which are experimental?_

If you agree to be in this study, the following will happen:
Your data from this class including grades, homework and exam submissions, and survey responses will be included in the analysis to determine the effectiveness of the pedagogical techniques used in this course compared to other similar courses.

_How much time will each study procedure take, what is your total time commitment, and how long will the study last?_

Your participation involves only agreeing to let us use your data in our analysis.  It will require no time on your part above the time you put into this course without agreeing to the study.

_What risks are associated with this study?_

Participation in this study may involve some added risks or discomforts. These include the following:

1.   A potential for the loss of confidentiality.   We will not share your personally identifying data with people outside our research team.  Data will only be kept in anonymized form for research purposes.  Course data will not be used for this research study until after final grades have been posted and will be rendered confidential by removing any identifiers before analysis.  Your instructor will not know whether or not you are participating in this study until after final grades have been posted.  Data from students who opt out of the study will be removed prior to data analysis.  Research records will be kept confidential to the extent allowed by law. Research records may be reviewed by the UCSD Institutional Review Board.

Since this is an investigational study, there may be some unknown risks that are currently unforeseeable. You will be informed of any significant new findings.

_What are the alternatives to participating in this study?_

The alternatives to participation in this study are not to participate.   If you choose to opt-out of participating in this research study, we will exclude your data from analysis.  Whether you participate will have no impact on your experience or grade in the associated class as the professor will not know who is or is not participating in the study until after final grades are assigned.

_What benefits can be reasonably expected?_

There is no direct benefit to you for participating in the study. The investigator, however, may learn more about how to improve student learning, and society may benefit from this knowledge.

_Can you choose to not participate or withdraw from the study without penalty or loss of benefits?_

Participation in research is entirely voluntary. You may refuse to participate or withdraw or refuse to answer specific questions in an interview or on a questionnaire at any time without penalty or loss of benefits to which you are entitled. If you decide that you no longer wish to continue in this study before the end of the quarter, simply respond to the online opt-out form here: https://goo.gl/forms/JSBRjEmkES6W6xYc2.  If you decide to opt out after the quarter has ended, you must contact Laurel Nelson (laureln@ucsd.edu) and give the quarter and the course from which you would like your data withdrawn.
You will be told if any important new information is found during the course of this study that may affect your wanting to continue.

_Can you be withdrawn from the study without your consent?_

The PI may remove you from the study without your consent if the PI feels it is in your best interest or the best interest of the study. You may also be withdrawn from the study if you do not follow the instructions given you by the study personnel.

_Will you be compensated for participating in this study?_

You will not be compensated for participating in this study.

_Are there any costs associated with participating in this study?_

There will be no cost to you for participating in this study.

_Who can you call if you have questions?_

Gabriele Wienhausen and/or her colleague has explained this study to you and answered your questions. If you have other questions or research-related problems, you may reach Gabriele Wienhausen at gwienhausen@ucsd.edu or (858) 534-3958.

You may call the Human Research Protections Program Office at 858-246-HRPP (858-246-4777) to inquire about your rights as a research subject or to report research-related problems.
