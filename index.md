# Introduction to Programming I (UCSD CSE 8A)

<a href="https://jpolitz.github.io">Joe Gibbs Politz</a> (Instructor)

In this course, you will learn to write, trace, and test programs; explore the
interactions between programs and data; and use computation to inspect and
manipulate media like data, images, and sounds.

We will explore these topics interactively in lecure, you will implement
programs to practice your programming skills, and you will reflect on this
learning through your own program designs.

This web page will serve as the main source of announcements and resources for
the course, as well as the syllabus.

This page, for now, is a placeholder and will be filled in with information
as we approach winter quarter. There are a few FAQs below that you may find
useful.

## Basics/Anticipated Frequent Questions

**I have constraints on my schedule/I'm in a time zone very different from San
Diego. Will this be a problem?**

We will have scheduled lecture sections in or around the official times
(Tuesday and Thursday evenings). These will be for discussion, interactive
work, and group practice for meeting classmates and learning togeher.
We won't track attendance for credit at these meetings.

There is a lab component to CSE 8A. (Some of) these will require synchronous
attendance. However, we will provide many times to complete lab work
synchronously and remotely, specifically to accommodate the wide range of
schedules and time zones of students taking the class.

**I heard this class uses Python/Java/both/some other language. Which is it?**

The course in winter 2021 will use Python nearly exclusively for completing
programming projects, as in fall 2020. For those continuing in sequence, CSE 8B
will be entirely in Java. The updated course description relative to past
offerings (and removal of Java from the title) is official, but hasn't shown up
on all the relevant systems yet so you may have seen an old version. Here's the
official course description:

> Course Title: Introduction to Programming and Computational Problem Solving - 1

> Introductory course for students interested in computer science and
> programming. Basics of programming including variables, conditionals, loops,
> functions/methods. Structured data storage such as arrays/lists and
> dictionaries, including data mutation.  Hands-on experience with designing,
> writing, hand-tracing, compiling or interpreting, executing, testing and
> debugging programs. Students solve relevant computational problems using a
> high-level programming language.   CSE 8A is part of a two-course sequence
> (CSE 8A and CSE 8B) that is equivalent to CSE 11. Students should take CSE 8B
> to complete this track. Students who have taken CSE 8B or CSE 11 may not take
> CSE 8A. Recommended preparation: No prior programming experience is assumed,
> but comfort using computers is helpful. Students should consult the “CSE
> Course Placement Advice” web page for assistance in choosing which CSE
> course to take first.
