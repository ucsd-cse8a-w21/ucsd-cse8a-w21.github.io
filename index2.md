# Introduction to Programming I (UCSD CSE 8A)

<a href="https://jpolitz.github.io">Joe Gibbs Politz</a> (Instructor)

In this course, you will learn to write, trace, and test programs; explore the
interactions between programs and data; and use computation to inspect and
manipulate media like data, images, and sounds.

We will explore these topics interactively in lecture, you will implement
programs to practice your programming skills, and you will reflect on this
learning through your own program designs.

This web page will serve as the main source of announcements and resources for
the course, as well as the syllabus.

## Overview

In general, in a week in this course, you will:

- Complete **readings and exercises** in an online textbook hosted on
Stepik (completing the exercises counts for credit), due on Friday at 4pm.
- Complete a **programming assignment or exam** (for credit), due on Tuesday
at 4pm.
- Attend and participate a group, synchronous **lab exercise** session on
Wednesday (flexible scheduling)
- Participate in, or watch later, **lecture sessions** on Tuesday and
Thursday evening (5-6:20pm or 6:30-8pm)
- Participate in, or watch later, **discussion sessions** on Friday (5-6pm or
6-7pm)
- Interact with me or other course staff to get some amount of help, either
through the message board, help hours, or one-on-one meetings.

In total, we aim for all of this (including lectures) to take you between
8-12 hours per week. If you find yourself taking substantially more than
that, consider asking the course staff for programming and study strategies.

## Calendar

The schedule below outlines topics, due dates, and links to assignments.
About a week in advance, all due dates, readings, and notable events in the
course. So if you check the schedule at the beginning of the week, you'll
know when all reading quizzes, programming assignments, etc. will be due.

## Grading

Your grade will be calculated from:

- 10% labs
- 10% reading, review, and drill exercises
- 30% programming assignments (PAs)
- 50% programming assessments
  - 3 during the quarter, plus one during finals week

## Labs and Check-ins

Each week on Wednesday there will be synchronous lab sessions where you work
with several other students and a tutor to practice your programming skills.
During the first few days of the quarter, you'll fill out this survey (fill)
so we can know your availability for different times on Wednesday and
schedule accordingly.

During lab, you will also have a chance for one-on-one check-ins with your
lab tutor for 5-10 minutes. This is a good time to ask any questions you have
about the course, note if you're struggling with particular concepts, need
help navigating the logistics of the course, and so on. You and your lab
tutor might schedule some additional time for a longer one-on-one meeting as
a result.

Labs will be designed to be collaborative activities, so you'll have to work
with your labmates to complete them and submit a summary document at the end
for credit. Labs are the **only** part of the course where synchronous
attendance is required for full credit. There will be make-up work available
if you miss a lab, but it will only earn half credit (note that this means
you can still get an A in the course without attending any labs, though we
don't recommend it).

## Reading, Review, and Drill

There is a free online textbook with built-in quizzes and practice
activities. You'll complete these for credit each week (due Friday), to get
conceptual background and practice with the new programming features for the
week. Your grade is based on the percentage of activities from the week's
chapter that you complete.

## Programming Assignments and Assessments

There are two types of programming work you will do outside of class and lab
– programming _assignments_ and programming _assessments_ (collectively
referred to as “PAs”).

Programming _assignments_ are primarily for your learning. Typically these
will involve writing some amount of code to solve a problem or build
something cool, along with some related writing and reflection on the code
and your process. On these assignments, we encourage collaboration with other
students, will give you lots of feedback in order to improve your
submissions, and the course staff will answer many kinds of questions and
give lots of help.

Programming _assessments_ are primarily for us to assess your learning. They
will also have you write code to solve problems, but you must complete them
on your own, and the staff won't help you solve the problems or write code
for them. You can think of them as open-notes, open-book exams where instead
of solving problems on paper you will write a program. In addition, on
assessments, you will record a short video of you demonstrating how you
program works according to a prompt we give you. They also won't be available
as long as the assignments; we will release them on Friday (rather than
Wednesday) and they will still be due Tuesday. This is because the
assessments are _shorter_ than the assignments, so we really just want to
give you enough time to schedule a 3-4 hour block of time to complete it as
if it's an exam, not treat it like a full-week project.

It's worth explaining why we are using this mechanism. There are at least two
reasons:

1. Presenting your code, and demonstrating it via screenshare, is a really
important skill and shows us a lot of your learning. Getting practice with this
style of presentation is a good thing for you to learn in general and a rich
way for us to assess your skills.
2. The main thing that in-person, on-paper exams let us do is easily verify
that it is in fact **you**, the student, completing a major assessment. We can
similarly do so with a video – many students are concerned that cheating will
be frequent in all-remote courses, and this is our way of ensuring that we are
giving grades to the people who earned them.

We will delete all the videos we receive from you after assigning final grades
for the course, and they will be stored in a university-controlled Google Drive
directory during the quarter only accessible to the course staff.

Please send a private message on Piazza or an email to the instructor if you
have concerns about this exam policy or cannot complete exams in this style for
some reason.

The schedule has a PA each week, where PAs 3, 6, and 9 are programming
_assessments_. There will also be a final assessment around the time of your
final exam.
